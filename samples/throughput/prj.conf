# Set the polling rate to 0 to disable the polling thread, and manually
# send measurements to the node processing engine. This can lead to easier
# instrumentation than when the polling thread is enabled, since processing
# of measurements happens asynchronously in a separate thread, meaning two
# runtimes needs to be combined for the approximate total runtime.
